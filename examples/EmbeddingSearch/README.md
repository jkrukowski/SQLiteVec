# Embedding Search

This is a simple example of how to use `SQLiteVec` to perform similarity search on embeddings.
It uses [`NaturalLanguage`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/naturallanguage/) to generate
embeddings for text and `SQLiteVec` to store and query the embeddings.

## Usage

Open `EmbeddingSearch.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run the project.
